👋 Nihao everyone!
I’m Kanzuba Artemiy, an Industrial Automation Engineer (ACS TP) with a focus on system administration in metallurgical production ⚙️🏭.

📚 I used to read a lot of programming books, but nowadays I’m a bit tired of pure theory (and don’t have much time), so in my free time I just write code for fun 💻✨.

🎮 Mostly, I enjoy creating console games — it really helps me relax 😌.

🛠️ Tech stack:

- Go (Golang) 🚀
- Docker 🐳
- Python 🐍
- PostgreSQL 🐘
- C++ ⚡️
- Bash 🐚
- Swagger 📖
- Postman 📬
(+ maybe something else, but that’s not so important 😅)
